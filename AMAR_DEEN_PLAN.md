# AMAR_DEEN_PLAN.md

**Project:** Amar Deen — offline-first Islamic companion app (Flutter)
**Base fork:** Sirat-E-Mustaqeem (372★, upstream: https://github.com/muhammadtalhasultan/Sirat-E-Mustaqeem)
**Benchmarked against:** Muslim Bangla, Muslims Day, Al Muslim, Muslim Pro
**Created:** 2026-07-19. Supersedes and merges `Sirat-E-Mustaqeem_Gap-Analysis_BRD_Refactor-Plan.md` + `AMAR_DEEN_AGENT_PROMPT.md` (deleted — this file is now the single source).

This is the standing operating manual **and** the BRD/architecture spec in one place. Read this file in full every session, then read `PROGRESS.md` (what's done) and `DECISIONS.md` (locked calls you must not silently reverse) before doing anything.

## 1. Objective & Constraints

Build a fully offline, no-backend Islamic companion app, Bangladesh-first (English + Bangla), matching feature parity with Muslim Bangla / Muslims Day.

Non-negotiable:
- **No backend.** Every feature works in airplane mode after first install.
- **Clean Architecture, Feature-First, Repository Pattern** (Section 5).
- **`flutter_bloc`/`Cubit` for state management — not GetX.** (locked, see `DECISIONS.md`)
- **Bangla + English localization from day one** — no hardcoded user-facing strings, ever, even in scaffolding.

## 4. Requirements Summary

**Functional:** on-device prayer time calc (no remote API) · Azan sound + per-prayer notification toggle · live countdown + current prayer window · full Quran text (Arabic) + English/Bangla translation + per-Ayah Tafsir · bookmark/resume last-read Ayah · categorized Dua/Azkar library with favorites · digital Tasbih counter with resettable target · Hijri date display + Gregorian conversion · Ramadan Suhoor/Iftar/Imsak countdown · English/Bangla language switch · light/dark theme switch · Qibla compass via device sensors.

**Non-functional:** offline-first (all core features work with zero network after install) · cold start <2s on mid-range Android · prayer calc <100ms · Azan notifications reliable across background/reboot (`flutter_local_notifications` exact alarms + Android boot-completed handling) · Clean Architecture separation · domain/data layers unit-testable without widget bindings · all strings in `.arb` from day one · location/sensor usage on-demand, not continuous polling.

**Success criteria:** all High-priority features implemented and airplane-mode verified · zero network calls for prayer times/Quran/Duas/Hijri calendar · clean `flutter analyze`, no deprecated-API warnings introduced · presentation never imports from `data/` directly · Bangla covers 100% of user-facing strings.

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Folder structure (Clean Architecture + Feature-First)

```

- **`domain/`** — pure Dart, zero Flutter/data imports. Entities, abstract repository interfaces, single-responsibility use cases (`GetTodayPrayerTimes`, `GetSurahById`, `ToggleDuaFavorite`).
- **`data/`** — implements domain repository interfaces. Local data sources (`adhan_dart`, bundled Quran JSON/SQLite, Hive boxes) + models mapping to domain entities.
- **`presentation/`** — widgets/screens + **Bloc/Cubit** (not GetX) calling use cases, never data sources directly. Follows the existing part-file convention already in this codebase: `x_bloc.dart` + `part 'x_event.dart'` + `part 'x_state.dart'` (see `lib/src/core/util/bloc/database/database_bloc.dart` for the pattern).

Repository pattern, apply to every feature:

```dart
// domain/repositories/<feature>_repository.dart
abstract class FeatureRepository {
  Future<Either<Failure, Entity>> getSomething();
}

// data/repositories/<feature>_repository_impl.dart
class FeatureRepositoryImpl implements FeatureRepository {
  final LocalDataSource localDataSource;
  FeatureRepositoryImpl(this.localDataSource);

  @override
  Future<Either<Failure, Entity>> getSomething() async {
    try {
      final result = await localDataSource.fetch();
      return Right(result.toEntity());
    } catch (e) {
      return Left(LocalFailure(e.toString()));
    }
  }
}
```

### 5.2 Tech stack (locked — see `DECISIONS.md`)

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| State management | `flutter_bloc` (Bloc/Cubit) — already fully in place, not GetX |
| DI | get_it + injectable |
| Prayer time calculation | `adhan_dart` (offline) |
| Hijri calendar | `hijri` package |
| Local storage (bookmarks, favorites, settings) | Hive |
| Local notifications | `flutter_local_notifications` |
| Localization | Flutter `intl` + `.arb` |
| Navigation | `go_router` |
| Testing | `flutter_test` + `mocktail` |

Do not introduce alternatives without flagging it as a decision request, not a silent substitution.

### 5.3 Migration strategy — incremental phases

1. **Phase 0 — Stabilize** (Epic 0): upgrade Flutter SDK/deps, fix build breaks, clean `flutter analyze`.
2. **Phase 1 — Scaffold** (Epic 1): `core/` + `features/` skeleton alongside existing code, no deletion yet.
3. **Phase 2 — Migrate feature by feature**, simplest first to validate the pattern before Quran (largest): Qibla → Tasbih (new) → Hijri Calendar (new) → Prayer Times (replace API) → Dua/Azkar (new) → Hadith → Quran.
4. **Phase 3 — Remove legacy code** once each feature's new implementation is verified in a real build.
5. **Phase 4 — New feature buildout** (Ramadan tools, Bangla localization, notifications) on the clean structure.

### 5.4 Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Dependency upgrade breaks existing UI | Manual QA pass before merging Phase 0 |
| Quran module migration regressions | Migrate last, after pattern proven on smaller features |
| Azan reliability on Android (Doze, OEM battery killers) | Exact alarms + guide users to disable battery optimization |
| Scope creep vs. bandwidth | Strict High → Medium → Low order; don't start Medium before High in an earlier epic is done |

### 5.5 Best practices
- One feature = one folder with its own `data/domain/presentation` — no cross-feature imports except through `core/`.
- Domain layer has zero Flutter/package imports — fast unit tests, no widget bindings.
- All repository access through interfaces — mockable via `mocktail`.
- Use cases are single-responsibility, not fat repositories called directly from UI.
- PR checklist: presentation layer never imports from `data/`.

## 6. Operating Rules (every session, no exceptions)

### 6.1 Analysis-first, confirmation-gated workflow
For every task:
1. **Analyze** — read the relevant existing code before touching anything. State what you found.
2. **Propose** — short plan: files touched, pattern followed, uncertainties.
3. **Confirm** — stop and ask before writing code, unless trivial (single file, <20 lines, no architectural decision). When in doubt, ask.
4. **Implement.**
5. **Report** — update `PROGRESS.md` before ending the session or moving to the next task.

### 6.2 Architectural discipline
- `presentation/` never imports from `data/` directly — always through `domain/` interfaces.
- Never introduce a second state management approach alongside `flutter_bloc` without flagging it and asking.
- Every feature module self-contained under `features/<name>/` — no reaching into another feature's internals; cross-feature needs go through `core/`.
- No feature ships without unit tests for its use cases and an airplane-mode verification note in `PROGRESS.md`.

### 6.3 Scope discipline
- Strict High → Medium → Low from Section 3. Don't start Medium/Low while an earlier-epic High task is incomplete, unless told to reprioritize.
- New scope discovered mid-task → propose it as a new task in `PROGRESS.md`, don't silently expand current task.

### 6.4 Reversibility rule
- Only what's under "Decided" in `DECISIONS.md` is locked. A past session finishing a task, or a past positive reaction, is not a lock — check before assuming.
- Don't reverse a locked decision without explicit new instruction in the current session.

### 6.5 Code quality bar
- Null-safety strict, no `dynamic` unless unavoidable (third-party JSON).
- Doc comment on every public class/method in `domain/`.
- effective_dart lint clean; zero analyzer warnings before marking a task done.
- Bangla + English strings added to `.arb` in the same commit that introduces the string.

### 6.6 Version control
- Repo is git-tracked from 2026-07-19 (baseline commit precedes migration work). Commit at the end of every completed task, small and reviewable.
- Never `push --force`, `reset --hard`, or discard uncommitted work without `git status` + confirming with Dipu first.

## 7. Epics & Tasks

### EPIC 0 — Stabilize
- [x] **TASK-001**: Audit `pubspec.yaml`, fix SDK constraint, upgrade dependencies. **Done 2026-07-19** — see `PROGRESS.md` for full detail (SDK constraint fixed, 6 major-version packages bumped, one breaking API fixed in `location_bloc.dart`, `pub get` clean).
- [x] **TASK-002**: Resolve remaining build-breaking issues. **Done 2026-07-19** — `keys.dart` now committed, reads key via `String.fromEnvironment`, no secret in repo, degrades gracefully. `flutter analyze` has zero errors.
- [x] **TASK-003**: Confirm green build on a real/emulated device. **Done 2026-07-19** — required a full Android Gradle toolchain migration (Gradle 7.4→8.14.2, AGP 7.1.2→8.11.1, Kotlin 1.6.10→2.2.20) plus replacing 2 dead plugins whose native code used removed Flutter v1-embedding APIs (`flutter_native_timezone`→`flutter_timezone`, `motion_sensors`→`flutter_qiblah`). Full blow-by-blow in `PROGRESS.md`. **Epic 0 is now fully closed.**

### EPIC 1 — Architecture Scaffold
- [x] **TASK-004**: Create `core/` + `features/` folder skeleton (Section 5.1), placeholder files only. **Done 2026-07-19** — see `PROGRESS.md`.
- [ ] **TASK-005**: `get_it` + `injectable` DI container in `core/di/`.
- [ ] **TASK-006**: `go_router` setup in `core/routing/`.
- [ ] **TASK-007** (partial): Migrate `Qibla` feature end-to-end — proof of pattern, smallest feature first. Sensor/bearing engine already replaced (`motion_sensors`→`flutter_qiblah`) as a side effect of TASK-003's build fix, collapsing `QiblaBloc`+`AngleBloc` into one bloc. Folder move into `data/domain/presentation` still open.
- [ ] **TASK-008**: Migrate `Theme` (light/dark) into `core/theme/`, verify toggle still works.

### EPIC 2 — Offline Prayer Core
- [ ] **TASK-009**: `PrayerRepository` interface + `adhan_dart`-backed impl in `features/prayer_times/`.
- [ ] **TASK-010**: Remove existing prayer-time API dependency entirely.
- [ ] **TASK-011**: Prayer countdown + start/end time UI.
- [ ] **TASK-012**: Voluntary prayer times (Duha, Ishraq, Tahajjud).
- [ ] **TASK-013**: Azan alarm system — `flutter_local_notifications` scheduling, per-prayer toggle, exact-alarm/Doze handling.
- [ ] **TASK-014**: Airplane-mode manual verification, logged in `PROGRESS.md`.

### EPIC 3 — Worship Essentials
- [ ] **TASK-015**: `dua_azkar` feature — categorized library, bundled local JSON/asset data.
- [ ] **TASK-016**: Favorite/bookmark for Dua/Azkar via Hive.
- [ ] **TASK-017**: `tasbih` feature — counter, resettable target, haptics.
- [ ] **TASK-018**: `hijri_calendar` feature via `hijri` package, current Hijri date across relevant screens.

### EPIC 4 — Localization
- [ ] **TASK-019**: Externalize all existing strings to `.arb` (English baseline).
- [ ] **TASK-020**: Bangla `.arb` translations.
- [ ] **TASK-021**: Language switcher in Settings, persisted in Hive.

### EPIC 5 — Ramadan Tools
- [ ] **TASK-022**: Suhoor/Iftar/Imsak derived from Fajr/Maghrib, countdown UI.
- [ ] **TASK-023**: Voluntary fasting reminders (Mon/Thu, Ayyam al-Beed, Arafah) via Hijri calendar.

### EPIC 6 — Quran Enhancement
- [ ] **TASK-024**: Migrate Quran feature into Clean Architecture structure.
- [ ] **TASK-025**: Tafsir data + reader UI per Ayah.
- [ ] **TASK-026**: Audio recitation + Qari selector (bundle vs. stream from EveryAyah/Quran.com — confirm with Dipu, streaming is a soft network dependency, must be optional/cached).
- [ ] **TASK-027**: Last-read position + bookmarks via Hive.

### EPIC 7 — Extras (low priority, don't start before Epics 0–6 substantially done)
- [ ] **TASK-028**: 99 Names of Allah — static content.
- [ ] **TASK-029**: Zakat calculator — formula-driven.
- [ ] **TASK-030**: Daily reminder notifications, reusing TASK-013's notification service.

### EPIC 8 — Polish (low priority, discuss scope before starting)
- [ ] **TASK-031**: Home-screen widgets (Android `home_widget`; iOS WidgetKit if scoped in).
- [ ] **TASK-032**: Confirm with Dipu whether Mosque Finder stays in scope (see `DECISIONS.md` open question).
- [ ] **TASK-033**: Hajj & Umrah guide — static content.
